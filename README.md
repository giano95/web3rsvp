# Web3 RSVP Project

In order to achieve a monorepo approach i split this project in 3 workspaces:

-   backend: Hardhat project where we defined the smart contract, we test it and deploy it
-   thegraph: TheGraph project were we create a GraphQL API in order to query data from the smart contract previously deployed
-   frontend: TODO
