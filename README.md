# Getting Started ü§ì

    -   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
        -   `yarn --version` and get an output like: `1.22.19`
        -   You might need to install it with `npm`

    -   You'll know you did it right if you can run `graph --version` and you see a response like `0.33.0`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/giano95/web3rsvp.git
cd web3rsvp
yarn
```

# Backend üõ†

## Deployment to the Hardhat net

Try to Deploy and Test the contract on the Hardhat Network and see if everything go smooth without error.

```
yarn hardhat deploy
yarn hardhat test
```

You can see the coverage of the Test by typing:

```
yarn hardhat coverage
```

## Deployment to Rinkeby and Mumbai testnet

The first thing to do is setup the environment variables, in particular `RINKEBY_RPC_URL`, `MUMBAI_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY`. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

-   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
-   `RINKEBY_RPC_URL`: This is url of the Rinkeby testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)
-   `MUMBAI_RPC_URL`: This is url of the Mumbai testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

In order to autamically verify the contract once deployed you need to set:

-   `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: This is the API Key of Etherscan, you can get one here [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/myapikey)
-   `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY`: This is the API Key of Polygonscan, you can get one here [Polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/myapikey)

To deploy the contracts you need some token to pay for the gas fees:

-   Head over to [rinkebyfaucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.
-   Head over to [mumbaifaucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/) and get some tesnet MATIC. You should see the MATIC show up in your metamask.

Now it's finally time to Deploy:

```
yarn hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
yarn hardhat deploy --network polygonMumbai
```

If everything go smooth you should see the Hashes of the deployed contracts on the console at run-time and also on the `exportContracts.json` file with the contract abis.

# The Graph üîç

## Setup

First LogIn/SignUp into [thegraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard) and click ont the Add Subgraph button and create two Subgraph with the following name:

-   `web3rsvp-rinkeby-2`: the one used to indexing and query data from the Rinkeby contract.
-   `web3rsvp-mumbai-2`: the one used to indexing and query data from the Mumbai contract.

Then generate the code:

```
graph codegen
```

And authenticate to your account by replacing `<access-token>` with your token:

```
graph auth --product hosted-service <access-token>
```

Now change the contracts addresses and starting blocks in the `networks.json` file with yours (the ones that you deployed [here](#deployment-to-rinkeby-and-mumbai-testnet))

## Build & Deploy Rinkeby

Build the graph with the Rinkeby dataSource info, and then deployed to its respective subgraph (replace `<account-name>` with your).

```
graph build --network rinkeby
graph deploy --product hosted-service <account-name>/web3rsvp-rinkeby-2 --network rinkeby
```

If everything go well you should be able to enter your subgraph, click the play button and run the example query without any error.

## Build & Deploy Mumbai

Build the graph with the Mumbai dataSource info, and then deployed to its respective subgraph (replace `<account-name>` with your).

```
graph build --network mumbai
graph deploy --product hosted-service <account-name>/web3rsvp-mumbai-2 --network mumbai
```

If everything go well you should be able to enter your subgraph, click the play button and run the example query without any error.

# Frontend üñ•

## Setup local variables

The first thing to do is setup the environment variables, you can add them to a `.env.local` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example.local`.

-   `WEB3STORAGE_TOKEN`: This is the API Token used to upload data into ipfs. You can get one [here](https://web3.storage/tokens/) after signing up.
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGON_MUMBAI_ALCHEMY_ID`: This is API Key of the Rinkeby app that you prevously created on [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_RINKEBY_ALCHEMY_ID`: This is API Key of the Mumbai app that you prevously created on [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

For easiness we are gonna also set the block's explorer urls:

-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_MUMBAI_POLYGONSCAN_URL`: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_RINKEBY_ETHERSCAN_URL`: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/

The last step of the setup is gonna be replace the Endpoint of the subgraphs we [previously](#the-graph) deployed. To do that replace the http queries with yours http queries in `apollo-client.js`.

```
const rinkebyEndpoint = new HttpLink({
    uri: "<web3rsvp-rinkeby-2-http-queries>",
})
const mumbaiEndpoint = new HttpLink({
    uri: "<web3rsvp-mumbai-2-http-queries>",
})
```

## Run locally

Now it's time to finally run locally on your web broswer this dApp, just run:

```
const rinkebyEndpoint = new HttpLink({
    uri: "<web3rsvp-rinkeby-2-http-queries>",
})
const mumbaiEndpoint = new HttpLink({
    uri: "<web3rsvp-mumbai-2-http-queries>",
})
```

And pray üôè the gods of conding that everything will go smoothly
