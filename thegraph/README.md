## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/giano95/web3rsvp.git
cd web3rsvp
yarn
cd thegraph
```

## Setup

First go to the `thegraph` folder then LogIn/SignUp into [thegraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard) and click ont the Add Subgraph button and create two Subgraph with the following name:

-   `web3rsvp-rinkeby-2`: the one used to indexing and query data from the Rinkeby contract.
-   `web3rsvp-mumbai-2`: the one used to indexing and query data from the Mumbai contract.

Then generate the code:

```
graph codegen
```

And authenticate to your account by replacing `<access-token>` with your token:

```
graph auth --product hosted-service <access-token>
```

Now change the contracts addresses and starting blocks in the `networks.json` file with yours (the ones that you deployed [here](#deployment-to-rinkeby-and-mumbai-testnet))

## Build & Deploy Rinkeby

Build the graph with the Rinkeby dataSource info, and then deployed to its respective subgraph (replace `<account-name>` with your).

```
graph build --network rinkeby
graph deploy --product hosted-service <account-name>/web3rsvp-rinkeby-2 --network rinkeby
```

If everything go well you should be able to enter your subgraph, click the play button and run the example query without any error.

## Build & Deploy Mumbai

Build the graph with the Mumbai dataSource info, and then deployed to its respective subgraph (replace `<account-name>` with your).

```
graph build --network mumbai
graph deploy --product hosted-service <account-name>/web3rsvp-mumbai-2 --network mumbai
```

If everything go well you should be able to enter your subgraph, click the play button and run the example query without any error.
